## 🖥️ SSR & Production Build

To build and run the application with SSR:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve:ssr:eCommerceSession
```

App will be available at: `http://localhost:4000`

---

## 🌐 Environment Configuration

API configuration is located in:

```bash
src/app/base/Environment.ts
```

> ✅ In production, you should:
> - Replace static `Environment.baseUrl` with `.env` support (using dotenv in server.ts)
> - Use different environments (`environment.prod.ts`)

---

## 🔐 Authentication
- JWT stored in `localStorage`
- AuthGuard checks login state
- Token is decoded via `jwt-decode` to extract user identity
- BehaviorSubject is used to hold logged-in user info

## ⚠️ Security Recommendations (Pre-Production)

> ✔️ = Implemented
> ❗ = Highly recommended
> 🔄 = Suggested enhancement

| Recommendation | Status | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Remove `console.log` in production code | ✔️ | Already removed from login/register/services |
| Verify JWT expiration in `auth.guard.ts` | ✔️ | Patched with `exp` check |
| Avoid relying on `localStorage` for token | ❗ | Use `HttpOnly` cookies via backend instead |
| Use Express middleware: `helmet`, `cors`, `rate-limit` | ❗ | Add to `server.ts` for added protection |
| Sanitize user inputs | 🔄 | Add `ngx-mask` or Angular sanitizers where needed |
| Avoid direct use of `headers.host` in SSR engine | ❗ | Use a trusted `BASE_URL` instead |
| Apply Content Security Policy (CSP) | 🔄 | Set strict headers in Express |
| SSR file path safety | ✔️ | SSR static serving is safe but should validate base paths |
| No API keys or secrets in frontend | ✔️ | All API endpoints are generic |
| Avoid CDN for critical assets | 🔄 | Move FontAwesome to local assets for reliability and control |

- [ ] Implement lazy loading for cart/products modules
- [ ] Add logout auto-expiry via token `exp`
- [ ] Translate form & alert messages (i18n)
- [ ] Optimize SSR render for speed with static generation
